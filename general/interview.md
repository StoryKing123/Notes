I am Xuan Zhi Tao. My English name is Steve.I'm 25 years old.I got my bachelor’s degree from guangzhou hua shang college.And I am happy to have the opportunity to introduce myself for the Senior Engineer at BASF. 

I have  3 year experience of development. Previously I workedd as a Web frontend deverloper  at Guangzhou Dalan Network Technology which is  a mobile game company. My mainly responsibility is to develop official game website and  SDK of games with javascript. Currently I worked in bamboo Technology since Novermber 2021.  In this period.The main technical platform of our company is powerplatform  which is a lowcode cloud platform from Microsfot. I  came into contact with many prducts,such as PowerApp , PowerAutomate and Dataverse. We use these new products to develop applications and then deliver them on Power Platform to user. My journey so far has included high-code and lod-code. I am also responsible for exploring the intergration of high-code and low-code.

I think that's all my introduction. Thanks for giving me the chance. 


- I currently work for HSBC as an outsource



我叫禤志涛，我的英文名是Steve，很高兴有这个机会介绍我自己。今年25岁。我是在21年从广东财经大学华商学院毕业的，毕业之后在广州大蓝网络科技有限公司就职，这是一家游戏公司。我的岗位是前端开发工程师，主要职责是负责制作一些游戏官网和一些游戏内置的SDK。然后从21年11月开始，我开始就职于广州奔步电脑有限公司，这家公司的主要技术平台是微软的低代码平台Powerplatform，PowerPlatform里面有很多的产品，比如Powerapps ，Powerautome和Dataverse。我们的工作内容主要就是以敏捷Agile的形式去用Powerplatform进行应用的开发和交付。由于我上一份工作是前端开发，所以在工作中我也在探索将前端融入到Powerpaltform低代码平台中，比如嵌入一个页面或者将前端代码封装成一个组件，放到低代码App中。

 I really need more information about the position before I can begin to discuss salary. Can you tell me the range budgeted for this position 



Well, according to my research and past experience, my understanding is that 20K to 22K per month is typical based on the role and requirements.


What do you consider your strengths and weaknesses?
I’m an organized person. I always plan ahead so that I can organize my time and work better. For example.
If a large task is assigned to me, I will first break down the task into subtasks, estimate the effort for each subtask, and then prioritize them based on their importance.

weakness. I'm a introvert.



Tell me about a time when you overcame a challenge at work
In a project, we were developing a system without predefined requirements. All the requirements had to be extracted from the source code of an old VB system. We spent a considerable amount of time analyzing the VB code, extracting and organizing requirements, and then confirming them with the users. Analyzing the logic from a VB system that dates back 20 years proved to be a challenging task for us.

Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a co-worker.
Tell me about a time you met a tight deadline.
Once a time, we faced a tight deadline when develop the application.We spent some time to organize the remaining tasks. We estimated the effort and priorities. In the event that we couldn't meet the deadline, we would request additional resources from supervise. If the team can handle the timeline, we were willing to work overtime to ensure their completion.


Tell me about a problem you've had getting along with a work associate.


Talk about a project you are most passionate about, or one where you did your best work.

In a project development, our team faced a resource shortage, and there was a need to complete tasks within a specified timeframe. I had to take on partial responsibilities for both business analysis (BA) and quality assurance (QA), engaging with users for requirement confirmation and participating in show-and-tell sessions. During this period, I learned from other BAs and QAs, finally  I completed tasks that I hadn't been involved with before. This is a huge success for me.

Do you have any questions for me?







Explain the cookie attribute: "SameSite".

The "SameSite" attribute in a cookie is used to control how the cookie is sent with cross-site requests. It provides a way to mitigate cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks by preventing third-party websites from making requests that include the user's authentication cookies.

The "SameSite" attribute can have the following values:

"Strict": This value ensures that the cookie is only sent in a first-party context. The cookie is not sent with any cross-site requests, including those made by the same domain but different subdomains.

"Lax": This value allows the cookie to be sent with cross-site GET requests, such as when a user clicks on a link or enters a URL in the browser's address bar. However, the cookie is not sent with cross-site POST requests, which could potentially modify user data or perform an action on their behalf.

"None": This value allows the cookie to be sent in all cross-site requests. It is used when the cookie needs to be accessed by third-party websites, e.g., for embedding external content or services.

The "SameSite" attribute helps protect user privacy and security by preventing unauthorized access to cookies and reducing the impact of CSRF attacks. However, it is important to note that not all browsers support this attribute, especially older versions. Therefore, implementing additional security measures and compatibility checks is necessary when relying on the "SameSite" attribute.



# 167. please briefly introduce yourself

 1 

As an AI language model, I don't have a traditional human-based self-introduction. However, I can share some tips on what to include in a typical self-introduction. Firstly, mention your name and educational background. Second, briefly talk about your work history or relevant experiences that make you a strong candidate for the position. Third, share a bit about your professional or personal interests and how they relate to the job. Lastly, wrap up your self-introduction with a positive outlook and eagerness to move forward in your career.

# 168. What is the difference between `display:none` and `visibility:hidden`

 2 

The main difference between `display:none` and `visibility:hidden` is their effect on the layout of a web page.

`display:none` completely removes an element from the page and does not allocate any space for it. As a result, the element is not visible and cannot be interacted with by the user or accessed by screen readers.

`visibility:hidden`, on the other hand, hides an element while still allocating space for it on the page. The element is not visible, but its space is still taken up in the layout. This means that other elements on the page will not move to fill the space left by the hidden element.

In summary, `display:none` completely removes an element from the page and does not allocate space for it, while `visibility:hidden` hides an element while still taking up space in the layout.



# 164. What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` ? Which one should I use?

`null` and `undefined` are both JavaScript primitive values used to denote emptiness or absence of any value. However, they differ in their meaning and usage.

- `undefined`: it is a primitive type that indicates an absence of a value assigned to a variable or a property. It also indicates that the variable or property has not been defined yet or has not been initialized with a value. In other words, a variable that has not been assigned a value is of type `undefined`.
    
- `null`: it is also a primitive type, but unlike `undefined`, it is explicitly assigned to indicate the absence of any value. It can be used to represent intentional non-existence of an object or a value.
    

In general, `undefined` is used when a variable or property has not yet been assigned a value, while `null` is used when a value needs to be explicitly set to “nothing” or “empty.” However, they are often used interchangeably in some cases.

As a developer, if you are unsure about which one to use, check the expected data type of the variable or property in question, and use `undefined` when something is simply not there or needs to be initialized later, and `null` when you need to explicitly set it as empty or non-existent.

# 162. What is the difference between function declaration and function expression?

 1 

Function declaration is a statement that declares a function and associates it with an identifier in the current scope. It is hoisted to the top of the current scope, so it can be called before it is declared in the code.

Example:

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

Function expression, on the other hand, is creating a function and assigning it to a variable. The function can be anonymous or named. It is not hoisted to the top of the current scope, so it must be declared before it is called.

Example:

```javascript
var hello = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
```

	In summary, the main difference between the two is the way they are defined and hoisted. Function declaration is defined as a statement and hoisted to the top of the scope, while function expression is defined as an expression and not hoisted to the top of the scope.


# 161. explain iterators and generators

Iterators and generators are two features introduced in ES6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015) that allow us to iterate through data structures like arrays and objects.

An iterator is an object that provides a sequence of values, one at a time. It has a `next()` method, and each time the method is called, it will return an object with two properties: `value` and `done`. The `value` property contains the next value in the sequence, and the `done` property is a Boolean that indicates whether we have reached the end of the sequence.

A generator is a special type of function that returns an iterator. We create a generator by using the `function*` syntax. Inside the generator function, we use the `yield` keyword to return each value in the sequence, and then the generator automatically pauses its execution until the next `next()` method is called.

Here is an example of an iterator and a generator:

```javascript
// Iterator example
const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
const myIterator = myArray[Symbol.iterator]();

console.log(myIterator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(myIterator.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(myIterator.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(myIterator.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }

// Generator example
function* myGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const myIterator2 = myGenerator();

console.log(myIterator2.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
console.log(myIterator2.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
console.log(myIterator2.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
console.log(myIterator2.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }

```


# 159. What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?

`git merge` and `git rebase` are two ways to integrate changes from one branch into another. The main difference between the two is that `git merge` creates a new merge commit, while `git rebase` re-writes the project history by creating new commits for each commit in the original branch.

When you use `git merge`, you are pulling the changes from one branch into another and creating a new merge commit. This means that the branch history will show a merge point where the two branches were combined. `git merge` is useful when you want to preserve the history of both branches, or when you are merging a branch that has diverged significantly from the main branch.

On the other hand, `git rebase` takes the changes from one branch and applies them onto another branch, as if the changes had been made directly on the other branch all along. This creates a linear history without merge commits. The main advantage of `git rebase` is that it simplifies the project history and makes it easier to understand. However, it should only be used when you are sure that the changes in the other branch do not conflict with your changes.

In summary, `git merge` creates a new merge commit and preserves the history of both branches, while `git rebase` rewrites the project history and creates a cleaner, linear history without merge commits.


# 156. what is `transform:translateZ(0)` for?

In short, the `transform: translateZ(0)` property is commonly used to trigger hardware acceleration in modern browsers. It instructs the browser to use the GPU (graphics processing unit) to render the element, resulting in smoother and faster animations and transitions. It essentially moves the element along the z-axis by 0 pixels, but the use of hardware acceleration can have a significant impact on performance.


# 155. how to improve performance of a webpage of a lot of images?

We can also optimize images by reducing their size or resolution, using compression tools, and leveraging caching and CDN (content delivery network) for faster load times. Additionally, we can use responsive design techniques to serve appropriate image sizes based on the user’s device and screen size. Lastly, reducing the number of images on the page or implementing lazy loading of images that are not initially visible can also improve performance.

# 153. why 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3 ? How to deal with float precision in your apps?

0.1 and 0.2 cannot be accurately represented in binary floating point format. When they are added together, the result is a number that has a very small rounding error due to the imprecise representation of the input numbers. This rounding error is small, but it's enough to make the result slightly different from the expected value of 0.3.

To deal with float precision in your apps, there are several approaches you can take:

1. Use a dedicated library that handles arbitrary precision arithmetic, such as bignumber.js or decimal.js.
    
2. Use string concatenation instead of addition. This avoids the imprecision of binary floating point arithmetic, but it can be slower and less convenient.
    
3. Use a tolerance or epsilon value when comparing floating point numbers. Instead of checking for an exact match, check that the difference between the two values is smaller than some small threshold value.
    
4. Use integer arithmetic instead of floating point arithmetic whenever possible. This is often faster and more precise, but it may not be suitable for all applications.


# 150. Explain the structure of a HTTP message

In general, an HTTP message is structured with three parts: the start line, the header fields, and the message body.

The start line contains information about the request or response, including the HTTP version, the method (for requests), the status code (for responses), and the requested resource (for requests).

The header fields provide additional metadata about the message, such as content type, content length, location, caching instructions, and authorization credentials.

The message body, which is optional for certain types of messages, contains the actual content being sent or received, such as HTML, XML, JSON, or binary data.

Together, these three parts form a standardized and extensible format that allows clients and servers to communicate over the web in a consistent and interoperable manner.



# 152. What is Generator and what is it useful for?

In short, a generator is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed during its execution, and allows generating a sequence of values.

It is useful for simplifying async code with the use of yield keyword, allowing for better control of asynchronous execution flow. It can also be used for lazy evaluation of sequences to optimize performance.

Generators are also often used in combination with Promises, allowing to implement a cooperative concurrency model.



# 149. Tell me more about Unicode and UTF-8

Unicode is a character set that defines a unique number (code point) for every character, symbol, and punctuation mark in every writing system in the world. UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format, 8-bit) is a variable-length encoding scheme that encodes every Unicode code point in one to four bytes, depending on its value. UTF-8 can encode any character in the Unicode standard, yet it is backward-compatible with ASCII. In other words, any ASCII-encoded text file is also a valid UTF-8 text file.

UTF-8 has become the dominant character encoding for the web, as it can represent every known character in the world with minimal overhead. It is also the default encoding for many programming languages, including JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby. UTF-8 is recommended for use in HTML, XML, and other markup languages, as it can handle any language or writing system in the world.


# 148. what is base64 ?

Base64 is a way to encode binary data in a format that can be easily transmitted over the internet. It is a mechanism for encoding arbitrary binary data into a set of 64 printable characters, which makes it compatible with systems that can't handle binary data. Base64 uses a set of characters to represent binary data as a string of ASCII characters, which consist of letters, digits, and symbols. It is commonly used for sending image, audio, and video files via email or other internet protocols.


# 147. What is Same-Origin policy ? How to share Cross-Origin resource?

Same-origin policy is a security policy implemented in web browsers to restrict web pages from accessing or manipulating data from another domain. According to this policy, web pages can only access resources (e.g., data, scripts, and cookies) located on the same domain and protocol, port number, and scheme.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that enables web pages to share resources from other domains. CORS provides a safe way to bypass same-origin policy restrictions by controlling the access to cross-origin resources through HTTP headers.

To share resources across different origins, the server hosting the resource must include appropriate CORS headers in the response. These headers include "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" and "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" headers that specify which domains are allowed to access the resource, the supported HTTP methods, and other security requirements such as authentication and encryption.

In summary, CORS is a mechanism to safely allow cross-domain resource sharing, while same-origin policy is a security feature that restricts web pages' access to resources on other domains for security reasons.


# 146. what is 'use strict' for?

As an AI language model, I can provide you with the answer that the "use strict" directive is used in JavaScript to enable strict mode, which makes it easier to write secure and optimized code by enforcing stricter rules and removing certain language features that can cause bugs or security holes. Strict mode also prevents certain types of syntax errors and encourages better coding practices.


# 145. how to implement user login?

There are several ways to implement user login, but here is a high-level overview:

1. Create a user model: Create a database table to store user data like username, email and password.
    
2. Create a login form: Create a login form that takes a user's email or username and password as inputs.
    
3. Validate user credentials: Check if the email/username and password combination entered by the user matches the one stored in the database.
    
4. Create a session: If the user has entered valid credentials, create a session to keep track of their login status.
    
5. Redirect the user: If the login is successful, redirect the user to a protected page. If there are any errors, display them to the user.
    
6. Logout: Provide a logout link that destroys the session and redirects the user to the login page.
    

The implementation details might differ depending on the specific technologies you are using, but the above steps should give you a general idea of how to implement user login



# 142. Are you familiar with webpack? how does it work?

Yes, I am familiar with webpack. Webpack is a module bundler that takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. It essentially takes all of the JavaScript, CSS, images, and other assets and bundles them together into a single file or multiple files, which can then be served to the client.

Loaders are modules that are used to process files, such as transpiling from ES6 to ES5 or converting CSS into JavaScript modules. Loaders allow webpack to handle non-JavaScript files by transforming them into valid modules that can be included in your application.

Plugins, on the other hand, are used to optimize and extend webpack's functionality. They can perform tasks like code splitting, asset management, and even serving your app. Some popular plugins include HtmlWebpackPlugin for generating index.html files, MiniCssExtractPlugin for extracting CSS styles into separate files, and UglifyJsPlugin for minifying JavaScript code.

Overall, webpack is a powerful tool that helps simplify the process of building complex web applications by bundling all of the necessary files and allowing developers to customize the build process with loaders and plugins.



# 141. What does Object.freeze() do?

Object.freeze() is a built-in method in JavaScript that allows developers to freeze an object, making it immutable; this means that no properties or elements of the object can be added, updated, or deleted. When an object is frozen, its properties are read-only.

This is useful when we want to ensure that an object is not modified after it has been created. This can be particularly helpful in preventing bugs caused by accidental modifications to an object.

Some use cases for Object.freeze() include:

1. To ensure that configuration objects are not accidentally changed
2. To prevent changes to constant values or hard-coded data
3. To protect objects that are being shared across different parts of an application
4. To create an immutable object that can be used as a key in a Map or Set data structure.



# 139. What would be the principles if you are to lead a relatively large Front-End project?

1. Define clear goals and objectives: As a leader, it is important to define clear goals and objectives for the Front-End project. This will help to guide the team towards a common understanding of what is expected from them.
    
2. Build a skilled team: The key to any successful project is a talented team. Hire skilled developers, designers, and other professionals who are passionate about Front-End development.
    
3. Plan and prioritize: Plan the project in advance, including the timeline, budget, and resources. Prioritize the features that have to be implemented first, then work on the less important features later.
    
4. Use industry-standard tools and frameworks: Use common Front-End development tools and frameworks that are widely accepted in the industry. This makes it easier for new developers to join the project.
    
5. Test, test, test: Test the Front-End thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected on all devices and in all scenarios. Don't rely on user feedback to identify flaws in the Front-End.
    
6. Communicate effectively: As a leader, communicate regularly with the team to ensure that everyone is on the same page, and that any issues or roadblocks are addressed promptly.
    
7. Document everything: Documentation is important for any large project. Document Front-End components, libraries, functions, and features so that new team members can easily understand the project.
    
8. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Implement CI/CD pipelines to continuously build, test, and deploy the Front-End project. This ensures that the Front-End is always stable and up to date.
    
9. Follow best practices: Follow best practices for Front-End development, such as code formatting, version control, and code documentation, to ensure that the project is maintainable and scalable.
    
10. Stay up to date with new technologies: Front-End technologies are constantly evolving. Stay up to date with new technologies and trends, and be willing to experiment with new tools and frameworks.


# 138. What is Block Formatting Context?

Block formatting context is a web design term used to describe a region in a HTML document where the layout of box elements is self-contained and independent of elements outside of it. It is used to prevent margins, paddings or borders of an element from overlapping or interfering with other elements, thereby providing clear separation between them. Examples of elements that establish block formatting context include floated elements, absolutely-positioned elements, and elements with the 'display: inline-block' or 'display: table-cell' property values.


# 137. What does`flex:1` mean?

`flex:1` is a shorthand property that sets the `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` properties all at once.

`flex-grow` determines how much the item will grow relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container when there is extra space.

`flex-shrink` determines how the item will shrink relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container when there is not enough space.

`flex-basis` sets the initial main size of the flex item before any free space is distributed, and specifies the default size of the item.

So, when we set `flex:1`, it means that the item will grow and shrink equally with the other items in the container, and its initial size will be determined by the available space in the container.


# 133. can you tell the difference between MVC, MVVM and Flux?

MVC, MVVM and Flux are all high-level architecture patterns used to improve the structure and organization of the code in software development.

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It is a design pattern that separates an application into three components: Model, View and Controller. The Model represents the business objects and data, the View presents the data to the user interface and the Controller handles user input, manages the flow of data to and from both the Model and View components.

MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel. It is a variation of the MVC pattern where the ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the View and Model components. The ViewModel exposes data from the Model to the View and handles View events, while the Model contains only the business logic and data itself.

Flux is a pattern used for building user interfaces in React applications. It is based on a unidirectional data flow, where the data flows in only one direction throughout the application. The Flux pattern consists of four components: actions, dispatcher, stores and views. Actions are user-initiated events that trigger a change in the application’s state, the dispatcher manages data flow in the application, stores contain the state of the application and views display the data from the stores to the user interface.

Overall, each of these patterns has its own strengths and weaknesses and can be used depending on the requirements and specifics of the project at hand. It is important to understand the differences between them to choose the best possible approach for developing robust and scalable web applications.



# 131. what is the difference between cache-control:no-cache and cache-control:no-store?

The main difference between `cache-control:no-cache` and `cache-control:no-store` is as follows:

- `cache-control:no-cache` means that the response can be cached, but the cache must first revalidate the resource with the server before using the cached version. This means that the cache must send a request to the server with the If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match header to check if the resource has changed. If the resource has not changed, the server will respond with a 304 Not Modified status code and the cache can use the cached version. If the resource has changed, the server will respond with the new version of the resource.
    
- `cache-control:no-store` means that the response cannot be cached and must be fetched from the server every time. This is usually used for sensitive data, such as personal information or financial data, to ensure that the data is not stored anywhere.
    

In summary, `cache-control:no-cache` allows caching but requires revalidation with the server, while `cache-control:no-store` prohibits caching altogether.


# 130. What is the difference between modules and standard scripts?

The main difference between modules and standard scripts is how they are loaded and executed.

Standard scripts are loaded and executed synchronously, meaning that they are loaded and executed in the order they appear in the HTML document. This can lead to blocking when scripts are large, and can also cause naming conflicts.

Modules, on the other hand, are loaded and executed asynchronously, and only when they are needed. This can improve the overall performance of the application.

Another difference is that modules have their own scope, which means that variables, functions, and classes declared inside a module are not accessible outside of the module (unless they are explicitly exported).

In terms of syntax, standard scripts are written using the `<script>` tag, while modules are written using the `<script type="module">` tag. Additionally, modules use the `export` and `import` statements to expose and consume functionality, respectively.


# 125. please explain the 3rd parameter of EventTarget.addEventListener()

The 3rd parameter of EventTarget.addEventListener() is an optional parameter that can be a Boolean or an Object. It specifies options for the event listener.

If it is a Boolean value of true, it indicates that the event listener should be registered as a capture listener, which means that the event will be handled during the capturing phase instead of the bubbling phase.

If it is an object, you can specify the following properties: capture, which is a Boolean that indicates whether to register the listener as a capture listener or a bubbling listener (false by default), once, which is a Boolean that indicates whether the listener should be invoked only once (false by default), passive, which is a Boolean that indicates whether the listener will never call preventDefault() (false by default), and signal, which is an AbortSignal object that allows the listener to be aborted (null by default).

Overall, the 3rd parameter enables you to have fine-grained control over how the event listener is registered and handled.


# 120. What have you learned from past professional working experiences?

Answer:

During my past professional working experiences, I have learned a lot about working collaboratively with colleagues and communicating effectively with clients. I have also learned to be adaptable and flexible in my approach to work, and to be able to accommodate unexpected changes or shifting priorities without losing focus. Additionally, I have learned the importance of being organized and prioritizing tasks to ensure that deadlines are met and projects are completed efficiently. Overall, these experiences have taught me to be proactive, accountable, and committed to delivering high-quality work to meet the needs of both the company and the clients.



# 119. What is the difference between `async` and `defer` on script tag?

In short, the difference between `async` and `defer` on a script tag is that:

- `async` tells the browser to download the script in the background and execute it as soon as possible, without stopping the parsing of the HTML page. This means that the script can be executed before the page is fully loaded, but it also means that the order of execution of multiple async scripts is not guaranteed.
- `defer` also tells the browser to download the script in the background, but it defers the execution until the HTML parsing is complete, just before the `DOMContentLoaded` event. This means that the scripts will be executed in the order they are defined, and won't block the rendering of the page.

So, in general, if the script does not rely on the DOM or other external resources, `async` could be a good option to speed up the loading time. Otherwise, if the script needs to access the DOM, `defer` is a safer choice as it ensures that the DOM is ready to be manipulated.

# 117. What is JWT(JSON Web Token)?

JWT is a compact and self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. The information contained within the JWT is digitally signed and therefore can be trusted by parties. JWT consists of three parts: header, payload, and a signature. The header typically consists of the type of token and the used cryptographic algorithms. The payload contains the claims or a piece of information such as user ID, expiration time or user roles. Finally, the signature is used to verify that the message has not been tampered with and ensures that the information is authentic. JWTs are widely used in web applications as a means of authenticating users and exchanging information securely between parties.


# 115. What is single sign-on? How to implement it?

  1

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication mechanism that allows users to authenticate only once, and access multiple applications or services without the need for separate authentication every time.

There are different ways to implement SSO, but the most common one is to use a third-party identity provider (IDP) that acts as the authentication source for all participating applications. The IDP generates a unique token for the user after authenticating them, which is then passed to the applications as proof of authentication. The applications can then verify the token with the IDP to grant access to the user.

Another way to implement SSO is using session sharing, where the user's session is shared between applications in the same domain. This can be done using cookies or by passing the session ID in the URL.

The pros of implementing SSO are improved user experience, simplified authentication process, and reduced administrative costs. However, there are also potential cons such as increased security risks and dependency on the reliability of the IDP.

To implement SSO, one can use standard protocols such as SAML, OAuth, or OpenID Connect, or use proprietary solutions with SDKs or plugins provided by the IDP vendor. It is important to ensure proper security and privacy controls are in place, and to test the implementation thoroughly before deployment.




# 114. What is CSS pixel and device pixel?

Yes, I do know the definition of CSS pixel and device pixel.

CSS pixel refers to the unit of measurement used in CSS to define the size of an element on a web page. It is also known as a logical pixel because its size is based on the resolution of the display screen and not the size of the physical pixel of the device.

On the other hand, a device pixel refers to the smallest unit that makes up a physical display screen. The device pixel ratio (DPR) is the ratio between the physical pixel and CSS pixel. It tells us how many physical pixels are used to display each CSS pixel. For example, if the DPR is 2, then two physical pixels are used to display each CSS pixel.

The `devicePixelRatio` property is used to retrieve the ratio between the physical pixel and CSS pixel on a device. It is commonly used in responsive web design to ensure that the web page is displayed correctly on devices with different pixel densities.

# 113. How do you create retina hairline(0.5px line in CSS)?

To create a retina hairline or a 0.5px line in CSS, you can use CSS Transform property to scale horizontal and vertical values to 0.5. Here is an example:

```js
.element {
  border-bottom: 1px solid black; /* original 1px line */
  transform: scaleY(0.5) scaleX(0.5); /* scale down the line */
  transform-origin: 0 0; /* set origin to top-left corner */
}
```

This code will create a thinner, retina-friendly line for the bottom border of `.element`. You can adjust the `transform` values to create thinner or thicker lines as needed. It's important to note that this technique may cause performance issues on older devices, so use it sparingly.


# 112. How do you target your web app to different screen sizes?

5. Use media queries in CSS to adjust the layout and appearance of the web app based on the screen size.
6. Use responsive frameworks like Bootstrap that come with built-in classes to enable responsiveness across various devices.
7. Use fluid layouts that adjust to the width of the screen, rather than fixed layouts that may be too wide for smaller screens.
8. Use font size and image size relative to the viewport rather than fixed sizes.
9. Test the web app on multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure it is optimized for each.
