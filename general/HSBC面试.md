# What Project are you most proud of and why?

```
You can find this project on my resume. The one I'm most proud of is the Electronic Warranty Card project, where I overcame numerous technical challenges. Let me highlight one particularly difficult issue we resolved.    
During development, we needed to implement a feature that allowed multiple barcodes within a single image to be recognized while meeting strict performance requirements. Initially, we tried using the JavaScript version of **ZXing**, but found that it could only detect one barcode at a time. After searching through npm, we couldn’t find a more suitable library, so we shifted our focus to the backend.    
Since our backend was built on **ASP.NET**, we explored the **C# version of ZXing** and were surprisely find that it supported multi-barcode recognition. We developed a functional version based on this library, but its performance could not meet user expectations.User required the entire recognition process to be completed within 3 seconds, but in reality, just the data transmission over the network already exceeded this time limit.   
To address this, I considered using **WebAssembly** to run C# code directly in the browser. After verifying compatibility, I successfully compiled the barcode recognition module into WebAssembly, enabling local processing in the browser and reducing recognition time by **3–4 seconds**.    
However, another challenge remained: **improving recognition accuracy**. By integrating **OpenCV.js**, I implemented image preprocessing to precisely locate and crop barcode regions before passing them to the recognition module. This optimization significantly boosted both speed and accuracy. Ultimately, we reduced recognition time from **10 seconds to just 1 second** while increasing the success rate from **70% to 90%**.    
This experience not only strengthened my problem-solving skills but also deepened my expertise in performance optimization and cross-platform solutions.

# biggest weakness　
```
My biggest weakness is my tendency to be a perfectionist. I often spend too much time on details that may not significantly impact the overall project. To address this, I have started setting more specific deadlines for each task and practicing letting go of non-essential details. This approach has helped me become more efficient while still maintaining high standards.

# How to handle conflict
```
In my previous job, I encountered a conflict with a colleague over project priorities. I addressed the issue by setting up a meeting to discuss our perspectives openly. I actively listened to their concerns and shared my viewpoint. We found a common ground and agreed on a compromise that satisfied both parties. This experience taught me the importance of open communication and collaboration in resolving conflicts effectively.

# 如何管理你的时间和任务
```
I use a combination of tools and techniques to manage my time and tasks effectively. I start by breaking down larger projects into smaller, manageable tasks and prioritizing them based on deadlines and importance. I utilize tools like project management software and calendar apps to keep track of deadlines and stay organized. Regularly reviewing and adjusting my plans ensures that I stay on track and meet objectives without feeling overwhelmed.
